# About me

I got into coding via _inkle's_ narrative scripting markup language _ink_, which I have used to create interactive fiction on itch.io
(you can find my profile [here](https://jack-of-qui11s.itch.io) if you are interested).

I have since progressed by learning python, and am currently finishing Harvard's CS50 course on edX.
