# About me

I got into coding via _inkle's_ narrative scripting markup language _ink_, which I have used to create interactive fiction on itch.io
(you can find my profile [here](https://jack-of-qui11s.itch.io) if you are interested).

I have since progressed by learning Python, and recently completed Harvardâ€™s CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course. This included a final project, for which I created a sophisticated 10k word interactive fiction browser game (_Through Glass Darkly_) using Python, Flask, SQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
