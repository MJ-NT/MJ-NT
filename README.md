# About me

I got into coding via [_inkle's_](https://www.inklestudios.com/) narrative scripting markup language _ink_, which I have used to create interactive fiction on itch.io
(you can find my profile [here](https://jack-of-qui11s.itch.io) if you are interested).

I then progressed by studying Python, and completed Harvard's CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course. For the final project, I created [_Through Glass Darkly_](https://mjnt.pythonanywhere.com/login), a sophisticated 10k word interactive fiction browser game, using Python, Flask, SQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

I am currently working on a showcase site and other projects to improve my skills.
