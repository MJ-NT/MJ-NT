# About me

I am a beginner coder looking to improve my coding problem-solving skills, with a current focus on python.

I got into coding via _inkle's_ narrative scripting markup language _ink_, which I have used to create interactive fiction on itch.io
(you can find my profile [here](https://jack-of-qui11s.itch.io) if you are interested).
I have since progressed by learning python, and am currently taking Harvard's CS50 course on edX.
